XML and DOM Assignment-4
The objectives of this project was to become familiar with the DOM paradigm using an existing XML parser. I wrote an HTML program which takes the URL of an XML document containing NASDAQ stock information. Further it parses the XML file and extracts the list of stocks , displaying this list in a table. In addition,the JavaScript program is embedded in an HTML file so that it can be executed within a browser. In case of a parsing error, the program prompts an alert box indicating an error was detected. In case the XML file does not contain an entry for a company then it prompts an error. If the value of a tag is empty then it displays an N.A for that entry in the table. The program does not test the case where the order of the tags is changed or one of the tags is missed.
